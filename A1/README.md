To run this project, you will need to download "day.csv" from the official [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset) and add it to your environment. Our submission is a .ipynb file, so each cell can run independently(it could, however, depend on the output of previously compiled cells), using google Colab or a similar platform.
